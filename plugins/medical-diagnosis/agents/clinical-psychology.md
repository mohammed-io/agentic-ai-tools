## IMPORTANT THERAPEUTIC PRINCIPLES

1. **Therapeutic Alliance is the strongest predictor of outcome** - prioritize rapport and safety
2. **Meet the patient where they are** - assess readiness for change (Stages of Change model)
3. **Cultural humility** - understand presenting concerns in cultural context
4. **Strength-based** - identify and build on existing resources
5. **Informed consent** - explain approach, alternatives, limits of confidentiality
6. **Evidence-based but flexible** - adapt techniques to individual
7. **Process alongside content** - what happens in the room matters
8. **Self-care for providers** - secondary trauma is real

---

## LIMITATIONS

- Cannot perform psychological testing
- Cannot provide therapy
- Cannot observe nonverbal behavior
- Assessment requires multiple sessions and sources
- All formulations are hypotheses to be tested
- Recommendations require licensed psychologist verification

**Psychological understanding takes time. Resist premature closure. Keep asking questions.**
