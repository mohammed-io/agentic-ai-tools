## PRIME DIRECTIVE: PREGNANCY STATUS FIRST

**BEFORE ANY ASSESSMENT OR TREATMENT:**
**Is this patient pregnant? Could they be pregnant?**
**NEVER assume. ALWAYS ask. ALWAYS verify.**

**Many medications and interventions are dangerous or contraindicated in pregnancy.**
**A missed pregnancy can mean catastrophic harm to mother or fetus.**

## MANDATORY FIRST QUESTIONS

### Pregnancy Status (ALWAYS ASK):
```
PREGNANCY SCREENING:

1. Is there any chance you could be pregnant?
2. When was your last menstrual period (LMP)?
3. Are your periods regular? What is your typical cycle length?
4. Are you using any form of contraception? Which one?
5. When was your last sexual intercourse?
6. Have you had a pregnancy test? Result?
7. Have you had any pregnancies before? Outcomes?
8. Any recent symptoms: breast tenderness, nausea, fatigue, missed period?

IF PREGNANT:
9. Gestational age? (by LMP and/or ultrasound)
10. EDC (estimated due date)?
11. Singleton or multiple gestation?
12. Any complications this pregnancy?
13. Prenatal care? Where? How many visits?
14. All ultrasounds done? Results?
15. Any prenatal testing? (NIPT, anatomy scan, GBS status)
16. Fetal movement present? (after ~20 weeks)
```

## OBSTETRIC EMERGENCIES - TIME-CRITICAL QUESTIONS

### Vaginal Bleeding in Pregnancy:
```
1. How far along is the pregnancy (gestational age)?
2. How much bleeding? (spotting, light, soaking pads - how many per hour?)
3. Color of blood? (bright red, dark, brown)
4. Any clots or tissue passed?
5. Any abdominal pain or cramping?
6. Any contractions?
7. Any history of placenta previa or low-lying placenta?
8. Any recent intercourse, exam, or trauma?
9. Blood type? Rh status?
10. Hemodynamically stable? (HR, BP)
11. Fetal heart tones present?

FIRST TRIMESTER BLEEDING - Consider:
- Threatened/inevitable/incomplete/complete miscarriage
- Ectopic pregnancy (LIFE-THREATENING)
- Subchorionic hematoma
- Implantation bleeding
→ Need: Quantitative hCG, ultrasound, Rh status

SECOND/THIRD TRIMESTER BLEEDING - Consider:
- Placenta previa
- Placental abruption (LIFE-THREATENING)
- Vasa previa
- Cervical insufficiency
- Labor
→ Need: Avoid digital exam if previa suspected, ultrasound, fetal monitoring
```

### Preeclampsia/Eclampsia:
```
1. Blood pressure readings? (current and trend)
2. Gestational age?
3. Any headache? (especially severe, not relieved by Tylenol)
4. Any visual changes? (blurred vision, scotomata, flashing lights)
5. Any RUQ or epigastric pain?
6. Any nausea/vomiting?
7. Any altered mental status or confusion?
8. Urine protein? (dipstick or 24-hour)
9. Platelets, creatinine, LFTs?
10. Any seizure activity? (if yes = ECLAMPSIA)
11. Any symptoms of HELLP? (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets)
12. Fetal status?

SEVERE FEATURES (any of these = severe preeclampsia):
- SBP ≥160 or DBP ≥110 (on two occasions)
- Platelets <100,000
- Creatinine >1.1 or doubling
- Liver enzymes 2x normal
- Pulmonary edema
- Cerebral/visual symptoms
```

### Labor Assessment:
```
1. Gestational age?
2. Contraction frequency and duration?
3. Any rupture of membranes? (time, color, odor, amount)
4. Any vaginal bleeding?
5. Fetal movement felt?
6. Cervical exam: dilation, effacement, station?
7. GBS status?
8. Any prior cesarean sections? (scar type if known)
9. Fetal heart rate pattern?
10. Maternal vital signs?
```

### Ectopic Pregnancy (LIFE-THREATENING):
```
CLASSIC TRIAD: Abdominal pain + vaginal bleeding + amenorrhea
But presentation often atypical!

1. LMP? Missed period?
2. Positive pregnancy test?
3. Location of pain? (often unilateral)
4. Severity of pain? (can be severe if ruptured)
5. Any shoulder tip pain? (referred from diaphragmatic irritation)
6. Any dizziness or lightheadedness? (blood loss)
7. Quantitative beta-hCG level?
8. Previous ultrasound? (IUP confirmed or not?)
9. Risk factors: prior ectopic, PID, tubal surgery, IUD, infertility?
10. Hemodynamically stable?

IF hCG >2000-3000 AND no IUP on transvaginal US → HIGH concern for ectopic
```

## GYNECOLOGIC QUESTIONS

### Abnormal Uterine Bleeding:
```
1. Age?
2. Menstrual history:
   - Age of menarche?
   - Typical cycle length?
   - Typical duration of bleeding?
   - How has this changed?
3. Current bleeding:
   - How long has abnormal bleeding occurred?
   - How heavy? (number of pads/tampons per day, soaking through, clots)
   - Intermenstrual bleeding?
   - Postcoital bleeding?
4. Associated symptoms:
   - Pain?
   - Discharge?
   - Fever?
5. Pregnancy status? (ALWAYS)
6. Contraception method?
7. Sexual history?
8. Last Pap smear? Results?
9. History of fibroids, polyps, or endometriosis?
10. Any bleeding disorders or on anticoagulation?
11. Thyroid disease?
12. Hemoglobin level?
```

### Pelvic Pain:
```
1. Location of pain? (unilateral, bilateral, diffuse, suprapubic)

## DRUG SAFETY IN PREGNANCY

### Before ANY medication recommendation:
```
PREGNANCY DRUG SAFETY CHECK:

1. Gestational age? (timing of exposure matters)
2. Indication for medication? (benefit vs risk)
3. Safer alternatives available?
4. Patient informed of risks?

AVOID IN PREGNANCY:
- ACE inhibitors, ARBs (fetal renal/CV abnormalities)
- Warfarin (teratogenic in 1st trimester)
- Methotrexate (teratogenic, abortifacient)
- Isotretinoin (severe teratogen)
- Valproic acid (neural tube defects)
- Fluoroquinolones (cartilage concerns)
- Tetracyclines (teeth, bone effects)
- NSAIDs (avoid in 3rd trimester - premature DA closure)
- Statins (contraindicated)

GENERALLY SAFE:
- Acetaminophen
- Penicillins, cephalosporins, azithromycin
- Metoclopramide, ondansetron
- Metformin (for GDM)
- Labetalol, nifedipine (for hypertension)
- Levothyroxine
```
