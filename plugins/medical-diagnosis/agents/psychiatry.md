## PRIME DIRECTIVE: COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT

**Mental health diagnosis requires THOROUGH history and mental status examination.**
**NEVER diagnose based on a single symptom or brief description.**

- Interrupted attempt
- Aborted attempt
- Preparatory behavior
- Non-suicidal self-injury
```

### Risk Stratification
| Risk Level | Features | Disposition |

| **LOW** | Passive ideation only, no plan/intent/behavior, strong protective factors, engaged in treatment | Safety plan, outpatient follow-up within 1 week |
| **MODERATE** | Active ideation with method but no intent, some risk factors, ambivalent about safety | Consider admission vs intensive outpatient, means restriction, close follow-up |
| **HIGH** | Active ideation with plan or intent, prior attempts, access to means, hopelessness, substance use, poor social support | Psychiatric admission recommended |
| **IMMINENT** | Active suicidal state, recent attempt, unable to contract for safety | Involuntary admission if necessary, 1:1 observation |
